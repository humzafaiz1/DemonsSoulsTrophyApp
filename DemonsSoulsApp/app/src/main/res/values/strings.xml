    <string name ="phalanx_trophy_guide">Phalanx is the Boss of 1–1 Boletarian Palace: Gates of Boletaria and is the first boss in the game. \n\n The Phalanx boss itself is will be keeping it\'s distance from you and doesn\'t actually attack you, while the Hoplites surrounding it will be the ones actually attacking you. Both the Phalanx and the Hoplites are weak to fire so you should first kill the surrounding Hoplites and when there is an opening to attack the Phalanx attack it with fire damage.\n\n Since this is early on in the game you can only use firebombs and pine resin for sources of fire damage. If you started as a magician you can also you the Flame Toss spell.</string>
    <string name = "tower_knight_trophy_guide">Tower Knight is the boss of 1–2 Boletarian Palace:The Lord\'s Path.\n\n
        Tower Knight is surrounded by archers which will be firing arrows down at you while you fight the Tower Knight. Run past the Tower Knight and eliminate the archers to make the fight easier. In order to get the One Shall Fall trophy you cannot eliminate the archers so it is recommended to fight the Tower Knight around the entryway to avoid as many of the archers as possible. \n\n
        Tower Knight\'s weakness is it\'s ankles, keep attacking it\'s ankles (the ankles will have a blue aura around them the more your attack them so you can see that it is taking damage) until it falls down. Once Tower Knight falls down, massive damage can be done by attacking it\'s head. Continue this process until it is dead.\n\n You can also aim at it\'s torso with a bow/magic which might make the fight faster if you are using ranged attacks. </string>
    <string name = "penetrator_trophy_guide">Penetrator is the boss of 1–3 Boletarian Palace: Inner Ward. \n\n Before fighting Penetrator you should rescue Biorr which will give you the trophy Brother-in-Arms and help with the fight since Penetrator will focus on Biorr a lot which will give you an opening to attack. \n\n To rescue Biorr follow the following steps:\n
        \n<li>1. Go to the Boletarian Palace: Inner Ward archstone.\n</li>
        \n<li>2. Proceed through the level until you can kill the first fat official. He should drop an Iron Key Ring.\n</li>
        \n<li>3. Go back to the Boletarian Palace: Inner Ward archstone but instead of going the way you did in step 1, turn around towards the Blue Eye Knights. To the right of the Blue Eye Knight facing away from you there should be a door you can unlock.\n</li>
        \n<li>4. Proceed down through the unlocked door and Biorr should be down there. Free him and go to the Penetrator boss fight and he will assist you during the fight which will also give you the trophy once Penetrator has been defeated.</li></string>
    <string name ="false_king_trophy_guide">False King is the boss of 1–4 Boletarian Palace: The King\'s Tower. \n\n Old King Allant always starts the fight with a lunge attack which you can roll for an opening. Keeping your distance from him is a good strategy since he tends to do the lunging attack to close the distance. If you see him charging an attack with wind effects around him either run very far away from him since this move does massive damage or interrupt it since it only takes one hit to do so. The main move you should watch out for is his Soulsucker spell since it will delevel you, the way to tell if he will do this move is if his hand starts to have a blue aura around it.</string>
    <string name = "armor_spider_trophy_guide">Armor Spider is the boss of 2–1 Stonefang Tunnel: Smithing Grounds.\n\n Before fighting Armor Spider you may want to equip the Flame Resistance Ring since Armor Spider uses a lot of fire based attacks. Once you begin the fight you have to proceed down the tunnel towards armor spider while dodging it\'s flame and web attacks. When you get close enough it will start to do physical attacks which you can dodge. Armor Spider may start to cover the tunnel in black oil and when it does the only way to get away is by running back to the start of the tunnel.</string>
    <string name = "flamelurker_trophy_guiide">
        Flamelurker is the boss of 2–2 Stonefang Tunnel: The Tunnel City. \n\n
        Flamelurker is a very aggressive boss who will also deal fire damage to you so the Flame Resistance Ring can help here as well.
        Ranged attacks work on him very well but going in with melee attacks may prove troublesome.
        Focus on dodging when it gets overly aggressive and heal when it is jumping around.</string>
    <string name = "dragon_god_trophy_guide">
        Dragon God is the boss of 2-3 Stonefang Tunnel: Underground Temple. \n\n You won\'t be attacking Dragon God directly instead you need to make your way towards the two ballistas on either side of the arena. Hide behind pillars and use ranged attacks on the debris to clear it. If you don\'t want to use ranged attacks, clear the debris with melee attacks while dragon god is not looking in your direction. Continues doing this until you press the button on both ballistas, once both have been used Dragon God will fall and his head can easily be attacked, but be sure to avoid his breath since it will hurt you. Make sure the finishing blow comes from the Hands of God weapon to get the Fists of Legend trophy. If you don\'t have the Hands of God weapon follow these steps to get them: \n
        \n<li>1. Go to the Underground Temple archstone\n</li>
        \n<li>2. Instead of going towards Dragon God go the opposite direction and keep going straight until you find three rockworms\n</li>
        \n<li>3. The item behind the three rockworms are the Hands of God.</li></string>
    <string name = "fools_idol_trophy_guide">
        Fool\'s Idol is the boss of 3–1 Tower of Latria: Prison of Hope. \n\n Before entering the fight with the Fool\'s Idol the prisoner in the tower above needs to be killed otherwise you can never permanently kill the Fool\'s Idol.If you need help finding the prisoner in the tower follow these steps:\n
        \n<li>1. Locate the giant ballista that shoots the volley of arrows and face the boss arena.\n</li>
        \n<li>2. Head to the tower on your right and continue forward until you find the door which should lead you to the prisoner who is casting magic. \n</li>
        \n<li>3. Kill him and proceed to Fool\'s Idol boss.</li>\n\n
        When the fight begins you should run straight to her and get in as much damage as you can before she teleports and creates clones of herself. Once she teleports she will now have clones of herself and traps on the floor around the arena. An easy way to determine the difference between a clone and the real boss is to lock on to each one, the clones will have small health bars above them while the real boss will not. This will also assist you to get the Not Fooled trophy. As the fight goes on the strategy remains the same there are just more clones and traps to deal with.</string>
    <string name = "maneaters_trophy_guide">
        Maneater is the boss of 3-2 Tower of Latria: Upper Latria.\n\n
        This fight is a bit tricky since the arena doesn\'t give you a lot to work with.
        The biggest move you have to watch out for is when Maneater dashes towards you, the best way to avoid this is by dodging in the direction of Maneater so that you don\'t fall off the side of the arena.
        If you need to heal you should run towards the brazier and heal around that area since it\'ll give you some cover from Maneater.\n\n
        Once you get the first Maneater\'s health low enough a second Maneater will come in to fight you as well.
        Once this happens you should still focus on the first Maneater and then repeat the same strategy on the second one.

    <string name = "old_monk_trophy_guide">
        Old Monk is the boss of 3-3 Tower of Latria: The Ivory Tower.\n\n
        For this fight you have the option of either playing online or offline. If you choose to play online Old Monk will summon a player into your world and you will have to duel them as the boss. In this instance there isn\'t a strategy since each fight will be unique.\n\n
        If you choose to play in offline mode you fight an NPC black phantom and this one isn\'t very difficult. You can use the chairs around the room to bait out an attack from the NPC which will give you an opening to attack. Be careful later on in the fight as they will start to use the Homing Soul Arrow spell on you.
    </string>
    <string name = "adjudicator_trophy_guide">
        Adjudicator is the boss of 4-1 Shrine of Storms: Island\'s Edge.\n\n
        Adjudicator has a weak spot on the top of his head which can be attacked with either magic spells or arrows from the upper levels and this is the recommended route if you are going for the One Shall Stand trophy. Just be careful of his tongue or cleaver attacks.\n\n
        If you choose to go the melee route then you can instead go to the bottom level and attack the meat cleaver stuck in his stomach. Once you attack it enough the Adjudicator will fall, giving you an opening to attack the bird on his head.
    </string>
    <string name = "old_hero_trophy_guide">
        Old Hero is the boss of 4-2 Shrine of Storms: The Ritual Path.\n\n
        Although not required for the fight the Thief Ring can be beneficial in this fight since Old Hero is blind and determines your location by the sounds you make.\n\n
        Old Hero is another fight where ranged attacks will be far easier than melee attacks but if you do try to go the melee route make sure to be patient and only go for one or two attacks before running away from him.
    </string>
    <string name = "storm_king_trophy_guide">
        Storm King is the boss of 4-3 Shrine of Storms: Altar of Storms.\n\n
        The very first thing you should do, especially if you are a melee build, is to run straight to the Storm Ruler weapon towards the edge of the arena. This weapon will allow you to make giant wind attacks that will reach the Storm Beasts and the Storm Ruler himself. This isn\'t required if you are using ranged attacks since you can attack Storm Ruler with your spells/arrows and will probably be easier than using the Storm Ruler.\n\n
        Once you pick off enough of the Storm Beasts, Storm Ruler will fly down and shoot a barrage of crystals at you. Take cover until the barrage ends and start to attack with your weapon of choice until Storm King is dead.

        Leechmonger is very easy to fight all you need to do is use some sort of fire damage. You can use any of the Fire spells or Pine Resin/Firebombs. \n\n
        The only things you may want to look out for is when he shoots a ball of leeches, if it hits you it will drain your health slowly. He can also regenerate his own health, when this happens you can attack his midsection to slow down the regeneration but you will probably deal damage faster than he can regenerate anyway.

        Dirty Colossus is also very weak to fire so use any fire spells or pine resin/firebombs and stay behind him.\n\n
        The only move to watch out for is when you have flies swarming you which will drain your health slowly. If this happens go to the torches around the arena and touch them to get them off of you.
    </string>
    <string name = "maiden_astraea_trophy_guide">
        Maiden Astraea is the boss of 5-3 Valley of Defilement: Rotting Haven.\n\n
        Maiden Astraea is an interesting boss because she doesn\'t attack you at all, you only need to watch out for her protector Garl Vinland. The easiest way to do this which will also net you the trophy May you be unharmed will be to attack her with arrows since magic attacks will not reach her. Find a spot opposite Garl Vinland and make fire away, make sure you have enough arrows since it will take a lot of them.\n\n
        If you choose to fight Garl Vinland be prepared since he is a very tough enemy. You can either dodge his attacks and attack when he gives you an opening or try to parry his attacks. Either way you will need a lot of patience since he has a lot of health and won\'t die easy. Once he is defeated go to Maiden Astraea and talk to her and she will die. Be careful of the swamp since it will plague you instantly and does a lot of damage.

        \n\nOnce you get all the rings that require Pure White World tendency and the trophies that require it as well, it is safe to go into Pure Black World tendency and collect all the rings that require Pure Black World tendency.
        To get Pure Black Character Tendency easily go into body form using a Stone of Ephemeral Eyes and die in whichever world you are trying to shift the tendency in.
        It should take around 7 deaths to shift the World Tendency from Pure White to Pure Black (make sure to travel back to the Nexus to see the shift since the shift will only be visible once you travel to The Nexus).
        Pure Black World tendency actually spawns in the 5 NPC Black Phantoms that you need to kill in order to shift yourself to Pure White CHARACTER Tendency. These NPCs are as follows:\n
        \n<li>Gates of Boletaria - Executioner Miralda\n</li>
        \n<li>The Tunnel City - Scirvir, the Wanderer\n</li>
        \n<li>Prison of Hope - Lord Rydell\n</li>
        \n<li>The Ivory Tower - Old Monk in online mode\n</li>
        \n<li>Island\'s Edge - Satsuki\n</li>
        \n<li>Swamp of Sorrows - Selen Vinland</li>\n\n
        Once you have Pure White Character Tendency go to The Monumental in The Nexus and he will give you the Ally\'s Ring.\n\n\n
        Now it is time to Pure Black Character Tendency to do this you have to kill harmless NPCs throughout the world (don\'t kill the ones in The Nexus). Here are a few NPCs that you can kill in the 5 archstones:\n
        \n<li>(1-1) Boletarian Palace - Dregling Merchant\n</li>
        \n<li>(2-1) Stonefang Tunnel - Filthy Man\n</li>
        \n<li>(3-1) Tower of Latria - Once Royal Mistress\n</li>
        \n<li>(4-1) Shrine of Storms - Graverobber Blige\n</li>
        \n<li>(5-1) Valley of Defilement - Filthy Woman\n</li>\n\n
        Once you obtain Pure Black Character Tendency go to the second floor of the Nexus and look for Mephistopholes and complete her quest. She will have you kill NPCs within The Nexus.
        Make sure you have bought all the spells\miracles you need since she will have you kill some of the people who give you these spells.
        Don\'t worry about killing them once you have all the spells that you can get since you will need to do a second playthrough of the game to get the remainder of the spells.
        Once you have finished her quest she will award you the Foe\'s Ring. After you have done all this start your second playthrough.

        Get the Time for Rolling Trophy here in case you missed it in the first playthrough.
        Be sure to kill certain bosses a specific way to get their trophy.
        This is also a good time to go for the two online trophies since Unwelcome Guest will mess with your Character Tendency.

        \n\nHere you have to use some save files in order to ensure you don\'t have to play the game a third time (this also requires a PSN account since at the time of writing this there\'s no way to backup your saves any other way on PS5).\n\n\n
        To backup a save go to Settings > Saved Data and Game/App Settings > Saved Data (PS5) > Console Storage > Upload to Cloud Storage > Check off Demon\'s Souls > Upload.\n\n
        To copy that backed up save go to Settings > Saved Data and Game/App Settings > Saved Data (PS5) > Cloud Storage > Download to Console Storage > Check off Demon\'s Souls > Download \n\n\n
        Once you beat all the bosses again (except the final one) backup your save first, then buy all the spells you can from Yuria and Freke once the Sage\'s Trophy unlocks quit out of the game and replace your save with the backed up one.
        Now go to Saint Urbain and purchase all of his miracles and the Saint\'s Trophy should unlock.
        If you don\'t want to do this method you must play through the game a third time so that you have enough boss souls.\n\n
        You should also get the Northern Regalia for the Legacy of the Kings Trophy. Refer to the following trophy for assistance on that:
